__Convert various data formats to GeoJSON or TopoJSON__

This package is a utility to convert geographic data to GeoJSON and TopoJSON formats. Nothing else. We hope to do this one job very well, and handle all reasonable use cases.

Functions in this package are organized first around what you're working with or want to get, GeoJSON or TopoJSON, then convert to or read from various formats:

* `geojson_list()`/`topojson_list()` - convert to GeoJSON/TopoJSON as R list format
* `geojson_json()`/`topojson_json()` - convert to GeoJSON/TopoJSON as JSON
* `geojson_sp()` - convert output of `geojson_list()` or `geojson_json()` to `sp` spatial objects
* `geojson_sf()` - convert output of `geojson_list()` or `geojson_json()` to `sf` objects
* `geojson_read()`/`topojson_read()` - read a GeoJSON/TopoJSON file from file path or URL
* `geojson_write()`/`topojson_write()` - write a GeoJSON/TopoJSON file locally

Each of the above functions have methods for various objects/classes, including `numeric`, `data.frame`, `list`, `SpatialPolygons`, `SpatialLines`, `SpatialPoints`, etc.

Additional functions:

* `map_gist()` - push up a GeoJSON or topojson file as a GitHub gist (renders as an interactive map)
* `map_leaf()` - create a local interactive map using the `leaflet` package

## \*json Info

* GeoJSON - [spec](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946)
* [GeoJSON lint](https://geojsonlint.com/)
* TopoJSON - [spec](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification/blob/master/README.md)


## Install

_Mac_

Install `GDAL` on the command line first, e.g., using `homebrew`

```
brew install gdal
```

_Linux_

Get deps first

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
remotes::system_requirements("ubuntu", "20.04", package = "geojsonio")
```


__Install geojsonio__

Stable version from CRAN

```{r}
install.packages("geojsonio")
```

Or development version from GitHub

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/geojsonio")
```

```{r}
library("geojsonio")
```

## What's the future of geojsonio?

geojsonio is stable and we expect it to stay on CRAN. The package is a 
dependency for a number of other packages and is downloaded tens of thousands
of times per month; moving forward the priority with this package is to make 
sure that those packages and users are able to keep using the package.

That said, we do not anticipate much further development; there will not likely
be many major new features added or new interfaces developed. We'll avoid 
making breaking changes as much as possible.

If you find bugs in geojsonio or want to contribute new features: please feel
free to submit PRs! So long as the existing interface stays intact, we'd be
more than happy to make the package more useful for you. That said, we don't 
anticipate being particularly responsive to feature requests 
(without a matching PR) moving forward.
